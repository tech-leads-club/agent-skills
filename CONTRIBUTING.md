## ⭐ Creating a New Skill

```bash
# With category (recommended)
nx g @tech-leads-club/skill-plugin:skill my-skill --category=development

# Full options
nx g @tech-leads-club/skill-plugin:skill my-skill \
  --description="What my skill does" \
  --category=development \
  --author="github.com/username" \
  --skillVersion="1.0.0"
```

The generator creates:

- `packages/skills-catalog/skills/(development)/my-skill/SKILL.md`

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does. Use when user says "trigger phrase".
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
  author: github.com/username
---

# My Skill

Brief description.

## Process

1. Step one
2. Step two
```

### Category Metadata

`_category.json`:

```json
{
  "(development)": {
    "name": "Development",
    "description": "Skills for software development",
    "priority": 1
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** — use `references/` for detailed docs
- **Write specific descriptions** — include trigger phrases
- **Assume the agent is smart** — only add what it doesn't already know
- **Prefer scripts over inline code** — reduces context window usage

## 🔒 Security Scan

Every skill is scanned with [`mcp-scan`](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan) before publishing. The scan is **incremental** — only skills whose content changed since the last run are re-scanned.

```bash
npm run scan              # Incremental (default)
npm run scan -- --force   # Force full re-scan
```

### How it works

Each skill has a SHA-256 content hash (computed from all its files). Results are cached in `.security-scan-cache.json` (gitignored). On the next run, skills whose hash hasn't changed skip re-scanning and load results from cache.

```
Content hash unchanged → load from cache (fast)
Content hash changed   → re-scan with mcp-scan
```

### Handling false positives

If `mcp-scan` flags a finding that is intentional (e.g. a first-party MCP server integration), add it to the allowlist:

**`packages/skills-catalog/security-scan-allowlist.yaml`**

```yaml
version: '1.0.0'

entries:
  - skill: my-skill
    code: W011
    reason: >
      Fetches from trusted first-party API — expected behavior.
    allowedBy: github.com/username
    allowedAt: '2026-01-01'
    expiresAt: '2027-01-01' # Optional but recommended
```

- Match is by `skill + code` — no re-scan needed after adding an entry
- `expiresAt` is optional but recommended — forces periodic review
- Expired entries re-activate the finding automatically
- Use YAML for better readability, comments, and cleaner diffs

The allowlist is committed to the repo and reviewable in PRs.

## 🔄 Release Process

This project uses **Conventional Commits** for automated versioning:

| Commit Prefix | Version Bump  | Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `feat:`       | Minor (0.X.0) | `feat: add new skill`        |
| `fix:`        | Patch (0.0.X) | `fix: correct symlink path`  |
| `feat!:`      | Major (X.0.0) | `feat!: breaking API change` |
| `docs:`       | No bump       | `docs: update README`        |
| `chore:`      | No bump       | `chore: update deps`         |

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions when merging to `main`.

## 🛍️ Contributing to the Marketplace

The Agent Skills Marketplace is a Next.js static site located in `packages/marketplace`. It serves as the frontend for browsing and discovering agent skills.

To work on the marketplace locally:

```bash
# Parse SKILL.md files and generate the JSON data used by the UI
nx run marketplace:generate-data

# Start the development server (runs with production config matching static export)
nx run marketplace:dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. For more details on the marketplace architecture, SEO optimization, and Next.js setup, see the [Marketplace README](packages/marketplace/README.md).
