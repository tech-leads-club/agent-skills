      "content": "# Cursor Skill Creator\n\nYou are an expert in creating Agent Skills following Cursor's pattern.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nUse this skill when the user asks to:\n\n- Create a new skill\n- Package domain-specific knowledge\n- Create reusable capabilities for the agent\n- Transform a repetitive process into a skill\n- Create quick, one-off actions (not complex tasks with multiple steps)\n\n**DO NOT use for complex tasks that require multiple steps** - for those, use subagents.\n\n## Skill Structure\n\nA skill is a `SKILL.md` file inside a folder in `.cursor/skills/` (project) or `~/.cursor/skills/` (user).\n\n### File Format\n\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: Short and objective description of what the skill does and when to use it (appears in menus). This description is used by the agent to decide when to apply the skill.\nname: Readable Skill Name (optional - if omitted, uses folder name)\n---\n\n# Skill Title\n\nDetailed instructions for the agent on how to use this skill.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- Use this skill when...\n- This skill is useful for...\n- Apply in situations where...\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n1. First do this...\n2. Then do that...\n3. Finish with...\n\n## Conventions and Best Practices\n\n- Always do X\n- Never do Y\n- Prefer Z when...\n\n## Examples (optional)\n\n### Example 1: Example Title\n\nInput:\n```\n\nexample input\n\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\n\nexample output\n\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Important note 1\n- Important note 2\n```\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nWhen creating a skill, follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Understand the Purpose\n\n- What specific problem does the skill solve?\n- When should the agent use this skill?\n- Is it a one-off/quick task (skill) or complex/multi-step (subagent)?\n- Who will use it (specific project or all projects)?\n\n### 2. Choose the Location\n\n- **Project**: `.cursor/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md` - only for the current project\n- **User**: `~/.cursor/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md` - available in all projects\n\n**Naming convention:**\n\n- Use kebab-case (words-separated-by-hyphens)\n- Be descriptive but concise\n- Examples: `format-imports`, `generate-tests`, `review-security`\n\n### 3. Write the Description\n\nThe description is CRITICAL - it determines when the agent uses the skill.\n\n**Good descriptions:**\n\n- \"Formats TypeScript imports in alphabetical order and removes duplicates\"\n- \"Generates Jest unit tests for React components following project patterns\"\n- \"Reviews code for common security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)\"\n\n**Bad descriptions (avoid):**\n\n- \"Helps with code\" (too vague)\n- \"Does useful things\" (not specific)\n- \"General skill\" (no context of when to use)\n\n**Formula for good descriptions:**\n\n```\n[Specific action] + [in which context] + [following which criteria/patterns]\n```\n\n### 4. Structure the Instructions\n\nThe instructions should be:\n\n- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous steps\n- **Actionable**: The agent can execute directly\n- **Focused**: One clear responsibility\n- **Complete**: Include all necessary details\n\n**Organize into sections:**\n\n1. **When to Use**: Clear triggers for application\n2. **Main Instructions**: Detailed step-by-step\n3. **Conventions**: Domain-specific rules and patterns\n4. **Examples**: Concrete use cases (optional but useful)\n5. **Notes**: Warnings, limitations, special cases\n\n### 5. Be Concise but Complete\n\n- Avoid long, rambling prompts (dilute focus)\n- Be direct and specific\n- Use lists and clear structure\n- Include concrete examples when useful\n\n### 6. Test and Refine\n\nAfter creating the skill:\n\n1. Test by making a prompt that should trigger the skill\n2. Verify that the agent uses the skill correctly\n3. Refine the description if the skill isn't triggered when expected\n4. Adjust instructions if behavior isn't as expected\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO\n\n- **Be specific in scope**: One skill = one clear responsibility\n- **Invest in the description**: It's how the agent decides to use the skill\n- **Use clear structure**: Headers, lists, examples\n- **Add to version control**: Share with the team\n- **Start simple**: Add complexity as needed\n- **Use concrete examples**: Demonstrate expected behavior\n\n### ❌ AVOID\n\n- **Generic skills**: \"Helps with general tasks\" is not useful\n- **Long prompts**: 2000 words don't make the skill smarter\n- **Duplicating slash commands**: If it's single-purpose, maybe a command is better\n- **Too many skills**: Start with 2-3 focused ones, add when needed\n- **Vague descriptions**: \"Use for general tasks\" gives no signal to the agent\n- **Complex tasks**: If it requires multiple steps and isolated context, use subagent\n\n## Skills vs Subagents vs Slash Commands\n\nUse this decision tree:\n\n```\nIs task single-purpose and instant?\n├─ YES → Is it a custom command?\n│         ├─ YES → Use slash command\n│         └─ NO → Use skill\n│\n└─ NO → Does it require multiple steps and isolated context?\n          ├─ YES → Use subagent\n          └─ NO → Use skill\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Skill**: \"Generate a changelog based on commits since last tag\"\n- **Skill**: \"Format all imports following the style guide\"\n- **Subagent**: \"Implement complete OAuth authentication with tests\"\n- **Subagent**: \"Investigate and fix all failing tests\"\n- **Slash Command**: `/fix` to fix linter errors\n\n## Quick Template\n\nUse this template when creating a skill:\n\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: [Specific action] for [context] following [pattern/criteria]\n---\n\n# [Skill Name]\n\nYou are an expert in [specific domain].\n\n## When to Use\n\nUse this skill when:\n\n- [Trigger 1]\n- [Trigger 2]\n- [Trigger 3]\n\n## Process\n\n1.

Identify all import statements\n2. Classify into groups:\n   - External (node_modules)\n   - Internal (relative paths and aliases)\n   - Types (import type)\n3. Sort alphabetically within each group\n4. Remove duplicates\n5. Add blank line between groups\n\n## Expected Format\n\n```typescript\n// External\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport axios from 'axios'\n\n// Internal\nimport { Button } from '@/components/Button'\nimport { utils } from '../utils'\n\n// Types\nimport type { User } from '@/types'\n```\n````\n\n````\n\n### Example 2: Changelog Generator\n\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: Generates formatted changelog based on Git commits since last tag, categorizing by type (feat, fix, docs, etc.) following Conventional Commits.\n---\n\n# Changelog Generator\n\n## When to Use\n\n- When preparing a release\n- When asked to \"generate changelog\"\n- To document changes between versions\n\n## Process\n\n1. Fetch commits since last git tag\n2. Parse messages following Conventional Commits\n3. Categorize by type:\n   - ✨ Features (feat:)\n   - 🐛 Fixes (fix:)\n   - 📚 Docs (docs:)\n   - 🔧 Chore (chore:)\n   - ♻️ Refactor (refactor:)\n4. Format in markdown with bullet points\n5. Include breaking changes in separate section\n\n## Output Format\n\n```markdown\n## [Version] - [Date]\n\n### ✨ Features\n- feat(auth): add OAuth login\n- feat(api): endpoint for file upload\n\n### 🐛 Fixes\n- fix(ui): fix responsive menu\n- fix(db): resolve race condition in transactions\n\n### 📚 Documentation\n- docs: update README with new endpoints\n\n### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES\n- feat(api)!: remove endpoint /v1/legacy\n````\n\n```\n\n## Creation Outputs\n\nWhen creating a skill, you should:\n\n1. **Create the directory**: `.cursor/skills/[skill-name]/`\n2. **Create the file**: `SKILL.md` inside the directory\n3. **Confirm location**: Inform where the skill was created\n4. **Explain usage**: How to test/use the skill\n5. **Suggest improvements**: If relevant, suggest refinements\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing a skill, verify:\n\n- [ ] Description is specific and clear about when to use\n- [ ] Folder name uses kebab-case\n- [ ] Instructions are actionable and unambiguous\n- [ ] Scope is focused (one responsibility)\n- [ ] Concrete examples are included (if applicable)\n- [ ] Sections are well organized\n- [ ] It's not a complex task (that should be a subagent)\n- [ ] Output format is clear (if applicable)\n\n## Output Messages\n\nWhen creating a skill, inform the user:\n\n```\n\n✅ Skill created successfully!\n\n📁 Location: .cursor/skills/[name]/SKILL.md\n🎯 Purpose: [brief description]\n🔧 How to test: [example prompt that should trigger the skill]\n\n💡 Tip: The agent will use this skill automatically when it detects [context].\nYou can also mention it explicitly in prompts.\n\n```\n\n---\n\n## Remember\n\nSkills are for **reusable knowledge and one-off actions**. For complex tasks with multiple steps, delegation, and isolated context, use **subagents** instead of skills.\n```",

      "content": "# Cursor Subagent Creator\n\nYou are an expert in creating Subagents following Cursor's best practices.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nUse this skill when the user asks to:\n\n- Create a new subagent/agent\n- Create a specialized assistant\n- Implement a complex workflow with multiple steps\n- Create verifiers, auditors, or domain experts\n- Tasks that require isolated context and multiple steps\n\n**DO NOT use for simple, one-off tasks** - for those, use skills.\n\n## What are Subagents?\n\nSubagents are specialized assistants that Cursor's Agent can delegate tasks to. Characteristics:\n\n- **Isolated context**: Each subagent has its own context window\n- **Parallel execution**: Multiple subagents can run simultaneously\n- **Specialization**: Configured with specific prompts and expertise\n- **Reusable**: Defined once, used in multiple contexts\n\n### Foreground vs Background\n\n| Mode           | Behavior                                          | Best for                                   |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| **Foreground** | Blocks until complete, returns result immediately | Sequential tasks where you need the output |\n| **Background** | Returns immediately, works independently          | Long-running tasks or parallel workstreams |\n\n## Subagent Structure\n\nA subagent is a markdown file in `.cursor/agents/` (project) or `~/.cursor/agents/` (user).\n\n### File Format\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: agent-name\ndescription: Description of when to use this subagent. The Agent reads this to decide delegation.\nmodel: inherit # or fast, or specific model ID\nreadonly: false # true to restrict write permissions\nis_background: false # true to execute in background\n---\n\nYou are an [expert in X].\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. [Step 1]\n2. [Step 2]\n3. [Step 3]\n\n[Detailed instructions about expected behavior]\n\nReport [type of expected result]:\n\n- [Output format]\n- [Metrics or specific information]\n```\n\n## Subagent Creation Process\n\n### 1. Define the Purpose\n\n- What specific responsibility does the subagent have?\n- Why does it need isolated context?\n- Does it involve multiple complex steps?\n- Does it require deep specialization?\n\n### 2. Choose the Location\n\n- **Project**: `.cursor/agents/agent-name.md` - project-specific\n- **User**: `~/.cursor/agents/agent-name.md` - all projects\n\n**Naming convention:**\n\n- Use kebab-case (words-separated-by-hyphens)\n- Be descriptive of the specialization\n- Examples: `security-auditor`, `test-runner`, `debugger`, `verifier`\n\n### 3. Configure the Frontmatter\n\n#### name (optional)\n\nUnique identifier. If omitted, uses the filename.\n\n```yaml\nname: security-auditor\n```\n\n#### description (optional but recommended)\n\nCRITICAL for automatic delegation. Explains when the Agent should use this subagent.\n\n**Good descriptions:**\n\n- \"Security specialist. Use when implementing auth, payments, or handling sensitive data.\"\n- \"Debugging specialist for errors and test failures. Use when encountering issues.\"\n- \"Validates completed work. Use after tasks are marked done to confirm implementations are functional.\"\n\n**Phrases that encourage automatic delegation:**\n\n- \"Use proactively when...\"\n- \"Always use for...\"\n- \"Automatically delegate when...\"\n\n**Avoid:**\n\n- Vague descriptions: \"Helps with general tasks\"\n- No context of when to use\n\n#### model (optional)\n\n```yaml\nmodel: inherit  # Uses the same model as parent agent (default)\nmodel: fast     # Uses fast model\nmodel: claude-3-5-sonnet-20250219  # Specific model\n```\n\n**When to use each model:**\n\n- `inherit`: Default, maintains consistency\n- `fast`: For quick checks, formatting, simple tasks\n- Specific model: When you need specific capabilities\n\n#### readonly (optional)\n\n```yaml\nreadonly: true # Restricts write permissions\n```\n\nUse when the subagent should only read/analyze, not modify.\n\n#### is_background (optional)\n\n```yaml\nis_background: true # Executes in background\n```\n\nUse for:\n\n- Long-running tasks\n- Continuous monitoring\n- When you don't need the result immediately\n\n### 4. Write the Subagent Prompt\n\nThe prompt should define:\n\n1. **Identity**: \"You are an [expert]...\"\n2. **When invoked**: Context of use\n3. **Process**: Specific steps to follow\n4. **Expected output**: Format and content of the result\n5. **Behavior**: Approach and philosophy\n\n**Recommended structure:**\n\n```markdown\nYou are an [expert in X] specialized in [Y].\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. [First action]\n2. [Second action]\n3. [Third action]\n\n[Detailed instructions about approach]\n\nReport [type of result]:\n\n- [Specific format]\n- [Information to include]\n- [Metrics or criteria]\n\n[Philosophy or principles to follow]\n```\n\n### 5. Be Focused and Specific\n\n- **One clear responsibility**: Each subagent has one purpose\n- **Concise prompts**: Don't write 2000 words\n- **Actionable instructions**: Clear and testable steps\n- **Structured output**: Well-defined response format\n\n## Field Configuration\n\n| Field           | Required | Default   | Description                                      |\n| --------------- | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| `name`          | No       | Filename  | Unique identifier (lowercase + hyphens)          |\n| `description`   | No       | -         | When to use this subagent (read by Agent)        |\n| `model`         | No       | `inherit` | Model to use (`fast`, `inherit`, or specific ID) |\n| `readonly`      | No       | `false`   | If true, write permissions restricted            |\n| `is_background` | No       | `false`   | If true, executes in background                  |\n\n## Common Subagent Patterns\n\n### 1. Verification Agent\n\n**Purpose**: Independently validates that work declared as complete actually works.\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: verifier\ndescription: Validates completed work. Use after tasks are marked done to confirm implementations are functional.\nmodel: fast\n---\n\nYou are a skeptical validator. Your job is to verify that work declared complete actually works.\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. Identify what was declared as complete\n2. Verify that the implementation exists and is functional\n3. Execute tests or relevant verification steps\n4. Look for edge cases that may have been missed\n\nBe thorough and skeptical. Report:\n\n- What was verified and passed\n- What was declared but is incomplete or broken\n- Specific issues that need to be addressed\n\nDon't accept statements at face value. Test everything.\n```\n\n**Use for:**\n\n- Validating features work end-to-end\n- Catching partially implemented functionality\n- Ensuring tests actually pass\n\n### 2. Debugger\n\n**Purpose**: Expert in root cause analysis and error correction.\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: debugger\ndescription: Debugging specialist for errors and test failures. Use when encountering issues.\n---\n\nYou are a debugging expert specialized in root cause analysis.\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. Capture the error message and stack trace\n2. Identify reproduction steps\n3. Isolate the failure location\n4. Implement minimal fix\n5. Verify that the solution works\n\nFor each issue, provide:\n\n- Root cause explanation\n- Evidence supporting the diagnosis\n- Specific code fix\n- Testing approach\n\nFocus on fixing the underlying issue, not symptoms.\n```\n\n**Use for:**\n\n- Complex or obscure errors\n- Test failures that need investigation\n- Performance issues\n\n### 3. Security Auditor\n\n**Purpose**: Security expert auditing code.\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: security-auditor\ndescription: Security specialist. Use when implementing auth, payments, or handling sensitive data.\nmodel: inherit\n---\n\nYou are a security expert auditing code for vulnerabilities.\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. Identify security-sensitive code paths\n2. Check for common vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, auth bypass)\n3. Confirm that secrets are not hardcoded\n4. Review input validation and sanitization\n\nReport findings by severity:\n\n- **Critical** (must fix before deploy)\n- **High** (fix soon)\n- **Medium** (address when possible)\n- **Low** (suggested improvements)\n\nFor each finding, include:\n\n- Vulnerability description\n- Location in code\n- Potential impact\n- Fix recommendation\n```\n\n**Use for:**\n\n- Authentication/authorization implementations\n- Code handling payments\n- User inputs\n- External API integrations\n\n### 4. Test Runner\n\n**Purpose**: Expert in test automation.\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: test-runner\ndescription: Test automation expert. Use proactively to run tests and fix failures.\nis_background: false\n---\n\nYou are a test automation expert.\n\nWhen you see code changes, proactively execute the appropriate tests.\n\nIf tests fail:\n\n1. Analyze the failure output\n2. Identify the root cause\n3. Fix the issue preserving test intent\n4. Re-run to verify\n\nReport test results with:\n\n- Number of tests passed/failed\n- Summary of any failures\n- Changes made to fix issues\n\nNever break existing tests without clear justification.\n```\n\n**Use for:**\n\n- Running tests automatically after changes\n- Fixing test failures\n- Maintaining a healthy test suite\n\n### 5. Documentation Writer\n\n**Purpose**: Expert in creating clear documentation.\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: doc-writer\ndescription: Documentation specialist. Use when creating READMEs, API docs, or user guides.\nmodel: fast\n---\n\nYou are a technical documentation expert.\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. Analyze the code/feature to document\n2. Identify audience (developers, end users, etc.)\n3. Structure documentation logically\n4. Write with clarity and practical examples\n5. Include code examples when relevant\n\nDocumentation should include:\n\n- Purpose overview\n- How to install/configure (if applicable)\n- How to use with examples\n- Available parameters/options\n- Common use cases\n- Troubleshooting (if applicable)\n\nUse formatted markdown, clear language, and concrete examples.\n```\n\n### 6. Orchestrator\n\n**Purpose**: Coordinates multiple subagents in sequence.\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: orchestrator\ndescription: Coordinates complex workflows across multiple specialists. Use for multi-phase projects.\n---\n\nYou are a complex workflow orchestrator.\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. Analyze complete requirements\n2. Break into logical phases\n3. Delegate each phase to appropriate subagent\n4. Collect and integrate results\n5. Verify consistency across phases\n\nStandard workflow:\n\n1. **Planner**: Analyzes requirements and creates technical plan\n2. **Implementer**: Builds the feature based on plan\n3. **Verifier**: Confirms implementation matches requirements\n\nFor each handoff, include:\n\n- Structured output from previous phase\n- Context needed for next phase\n- Clear success criteria\n```\n\n## Using Subagents\n\n### Automatic Delegation\n\nThe Agent delegates automatically based on:\n\n- Task complexity and scope\n- Custom subagent descriptions\n- Current context and available tools\n\n**Encourage automatic delegation** using phrases in the description:\n\n- \"Use proactively when...\"\n- \"Always use for...\"\n- \"Automatically apply when...\"\n\n### Explicit Invocation\n\n`/name` syntax:\n\n```\n> /verifier confirm that the auth flow is complete\n> /debugger investigate this error\n> /security-auditor review the payment module\n```\n\nOr natural mention:\n\n```\n> Use the verifier subagent to confirm the auth flow is complete\n> Ask the debugger subagent to investigate this error\n> Run the security-auditor subagent on the payment module\n```\n\n### Parallel Execution\n\nLaunch multiple subagents simultaneously:\n\n```\n> Review the API changes and update documentation in parallel\n```\n\nThe Agent sends multiple Task tool calls in a single message.\n\n## Resuming Subagents\n\nSubagents can be resumed to continue previous conversations.\n\nEach execution returns an agent ID. Pass this ID to resume with preserved context:\n\n```\n> Resume agent abc123 and analyze remaining test failures\n```\n\nBackground subagents write their state while executing in `~/.cursor/subagents/`.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO\n\n- **Write focused subagents**: One clear responsibility\n- **Invest in the description**: Determines when the Agent delegates\n- **Keep prompts concise**: Direct and specific\n- **Add to version control**: Share `.cursor/agents/` with the team\n- **Start with Agent-generated**: Let the Agent create the initial draft\n- **Use hooks for file output**: For consistent structured output\n- **Test the description**: Make prompts and see if the correct subagent is triggered\n\n### ❌ AVOID\n\n- **Dozens of generic subagents**: 50+ vague subagents are ineffective\n- **Vague descriptions**: \"Use for general tasks\" gives no signal\n- **Prompts too long**: 2000 words don't make the subagent smarter\n- **Duplicating slash commands**: Use skill if it's single-purpose without context isolation\n- **Too many subagents**: Start with 2-3 focused ones, add as needed\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n⚠️ **Vague descriptions**: \"Use for general tasks\" → Be specific: \"Use when implementing authentication flows with OAuth providers.\"\n\n⚠️ **Prompts too long**: A 2000-word prompt is slower and harder to maintain.\n\n⚠️ **Duplicating slash commands**: If it's single-purpose without context isolation, use skill.\n\n⚠️ **Too many subagents**: Start with 2-3 focused ones. Add only with distinct use cases.\n\n## Skills vs Subagents vs Commands\n\nUse this decision tree:\n\n```\nIs the task complex with multiple steps?\n├─ YES → Does it require isolated context?\n│         ├─ YES → Use SUBAGENT\n│         └─ NO → Use SKILL\n│\n└─ NO → Is it a single, one-off action?\n          ├─ YES → Is it a custom command?\n│                 ├─ YES → Use slash command\n│                 └─ NO → Use SKILL\n          └─ NO → Use SUBAGENT\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Subagent**: \"Implement complete OAuth authentication with tests and documentation\"\n- **Subagent**: \"Investigate all failing tests and fix them\"\n- **Subagent**: \"Perform complete security audit of the payments module\"\n- **Skill**: \"Generate changelog based on commits\"\n- **Skill**: \"Format file imports\"\n- **Command**: `/fix` to fix linter errors\n\n## Performance and Cost\n\nSubagents have trade-offs:\n\n| Benefit            | Trade-off                                                 |\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Context isolation  | Startup overhead (each subagent collects its own context) |\n| Parallel execution | Higher token usage (multiple contexts simultaneously)     |\n| Specialized focus  | Latency (can be slower than main agent for simple tasks)  |\n\n### Token and Cost Considerations\n\n- **Subagents consume tokens independently**: Each has its own context window\n- **Parallel execution multiplies tokens**: 5 subagents = ~5x the tokens of a single agent\n- **Evaluate the overhead**: For quick/simple tasks, the main agent is more efficient\n- **Subagents can be slower**: The benefit is isolation, not speed\n\n## Quick Template\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: [agent-name]\ndescription: [Expert in X].

      "content": "# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective, agent-agnostic skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend AI agent capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific domains or tasks—they transform a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. **Specialized workflows** - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. **Tool integrations** - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. **Domain expertise** - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. **Bundled resources** - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share context with everything else the agent needs.\n\n**Default assumption: The agent is already very smart.** Only add context it doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does the agent really need this?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields read to determine when the skill gets used—be clear and comprehensive.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers.\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material loaded as needed into context.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation the agent should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/schema.md` for database schemas, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when needed\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but used within output.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files for final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/template.html` for HTML boilerplate\n\n### Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited)\n\nKeep SKILL.md body under 500 lines. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Skill\n\nClarify with concrete examples:\n\n- \"What functionality should this skill support?\"\n- \"Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"What would trigger this skill?\"\n\n### Step 2: Plan Reusable Contents\n\nAnalyze each example:\n\n1. Consider how to execute from scratch\n2. Identify helpful scripts, references, and assets\n\n### Step 3: Create the Skill\n\nCreate the skill directory:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md\n├── scripts/     (if needed)\n├── references/  (if needed)\n└── assets/      (if needed)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Write SKILL.md\n\n#### Frontmatter\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: skill-name\ndescription: What the skill does and when to use it. Include specific triggers and contexts. Max 1024 characters.\n---\n```\n\n**Description guidelines:**\n\n- Include both what the skill does AND when to use it\n- Include trigger phrases\n- Max 1024 characters, no XML tags\n- Write in third person\n\n#### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill. Include:\n\n- Quick start guide\n- Step-by-step workflow\n- Links to reference files when needed\n\n### Step 5: Test and Iterate\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Update SKILL.md or resources accordingly\n4. Test again\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing:\n\n- [ ] Description is specific about when to use (max 1024 chars)\n- [ ] Folder name uses kebab-case\n- [ ] Instructions are actionable and unambiguous\n- [ ] Scope is focused (one responsibility)\n- [ ] SKILL.md body < 500 lines\n- [ ] References are one level deep from SKILL.md\n\n## Output Messages\n\nWhen creating a skill, inform the user:\n\n```\n✅ Skill created successfully!\n\n📁 Location: .agent/skills/[name]/SKILL.md\n🎯 Purpose: [brief description]\n🔧 How to test: [example prompt that should trigger the skill]\n\n💡 Tip: The agent will use this skill automatically when it detects [context].\n```",

      "content": "# Subagent Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective, agent-agnostic subagents.\n\n## What are Subagents?\n\nSubagents are specialized assistants that an AI agent can delegate tasks to. Characteristics:\n\n- **Isolated context**: Each subagent has its own context window\n- **Parallel execution**: Multiple subagents can run simultaneously\n- **Specialization**: Configured with specific prompts and expertise\n- **Reusable**: Defined once, used in multiple contexts\n\n### When to Use Subagents vs Skills\n\n```\nIs the task complex with multiple steps?\n├─ YES → Does it require isolated context?\n│         ├─ YES → Use SUBAGENT\n│         └─ NO → Use SKILL\n│\n└─ NO → Use SKILL\n```\n\n**Use Subagents for:**\n\n- Complex workflows requiring isolated context\n- Long-running tasks that benefit from specialization\n- Verification and auditing (independent perspective)\n- Parallel workstreams\n\n**Use Skills for:**\n\n- Quick, one-off actions\n- Domain knowledge without context isolation\n- Reusable procedures that don't need isolation\n\n## Subagent Structure\n\nA subagent is typically a markdown file with frontmatter metadata:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: agent-name\ndescription: Description of when to use this subagent.\nmodel: inherit # or fast, or specific model ID\nreadonly: false # true to restrict write permissions\n---\n\nYou are an [expert in X].\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. [Step 1]\n2. [Step 2]\n3. [Step 3]\n\n[Detailed instructions about expected behavior]\n\nReport [type of expected result]:\n\n- [Output format]\n- [Metrics or specific information]\n```\n\n## Subagent Creation Process\n\n### 1. Define the Purpose\n\n- What specific responsibility does the subagent have?\n- Why does it need isolated context?\n- Does it involve multiple complex steps?\n- Does it require deep specialization?\n\n### 2. Configure the Metadata\n\n#### name (required)\n\nUnique identifier. Use kebab-case.\n\n```yaml\nname: security-auditor\n```\n\n#### description (critical)\n\nCRITICAL for automatic delegation. Explains when to use this subagent.\n\n**Good descriptions:**\n\n- \"Security specialist. Use when implementing auth, payments, or handling sensitive data.\"\n- \"Debugging specialist for errors and test failures. Use when encountering issues.\"\n- \"Validates completed work. Use after tasks are marked done.\"\n\n**Phrases that encourage automatic delegation:**\n\n- \"Use proactively when...\"\n- \"Always use for...\"\n- \"Automatically delegate when...\"\n\n#### model (optional)\n\n```yaml\nmodel: inherit  # Uses same model as parent (default)\nmodel: fast     # Uses fast model for quick tasks\n```\n\n#### readonly (optional)\n\n```yaml\nreadonly: true # Restricts write permissions\n```\n\n### 3. Write the Subagent Prompt\n\nDefine:\n\n1. **Identity**: \"You are an [expert]...\"\n2. **When invoked**: Context of use\n3. **Process**: Specific steps to follow\n4. **Expected output**: Format and content\n\n**Template:**\n\n```markdown\nYou are an [expert in X] specialized in [Y].\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. [First action]\n2. [Second action]\n3. [Third action]\n\n[Detailed instructions about approach]\n\nReport [type of result]:\n\n- [Specific format]\n- [Information to include]\n- [Metrics or criteria]\n\n[Philosophy or principles to follow]\n```\n\n## Common Subagent Patterns\n\n### 1. Verification Agent\n\n**Purpose**: Independently validates that completed work actually works.\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: verifier\ndescription: Validates completed work. Use after tasks are marked done.\nmodel: fast\n---\n\nYou are a skeptical validator.\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. Identify what was declared as complete\n2. Verify the implementation exists and is functional\n3. Execute tests or relevant verification steps\n4. Look for edge cases that may have been missed\n\nBe thorough. Report:\n\n- What was verified and passed\n- What is incomplete or broken\n- Specific issues to address\n```\n\n### 2. Debugger\n\n**Purpose**: Expert in root cause analysis.\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: debugger\ndescription: Debugging specialist. Use when encountering errors or test failures.\n---\n\nYou are a debugging expert.\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. Capture the error message and stack trace\n2. Identify reproduction steps\n3. Isolate the failure location\n4. Implement minimal fix\n5. Verify the solution works\n\nFor each issue, provide:\n\n- Root cause explanation\n- Evidence supporting the diagnosis\n- Specific code fix\n- Testing approach\n```\n\n### 3. Security Auditor\n\n**Purpose**: Security expert auditing code.\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: security-auditor\ndescription: Security specialist. Use for auth, payments, or sensitive data.\n---\n\nYou are a security expert.\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. Identify security-sensitive code paths\n2. Check for common vulnerabilities\n3. Confirm secrets are not hardcoded\n4. Review input validation\n\nReport findings by severity:\n\n- **Critical** (must fix before deploy)\n- **High** (fix soon)\n- **Medium** (address when possible)\n- **Low** (suggestions)\n```\n\n### 4. Code Reviewer\n\n**Purpose**: Code review with focus on quality.\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: code-reviewer\ndescription: Code review specialist. Use when changes are ready for review.\n---\n\nYou are a code review expert.\n\nWhen invoked:\n\n1. Analyze the code changes\n2. Check readability, performance, patterns, error handling\n3. Identify code smells and potential bugs\n4. Suggest specific improvements\n\nReport:\n**✅ Approved / ⚠️ Approved with caveats / ❌ Changes needed**\n\n**Issues Found:**\n\n- **[Severity]** [Location]: [Issue]\n  - Suggestion: [How to fix]\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### ✅ DO\n\n- **Write focused subagents**: One clear responsibility\n- **Invest in the description**: Determines when to delegate\n- **Keep prompts concise**: Direct and specific\n- **Share with team**: Version control subagent definitions\n- **Test the description**: Check correct subagent is triggered\n\n### ❌ AVOID\n\n- **Vague descriptions**: \"Use for general tasks\" gives no signal\n- **Prompts too long**: 2000 words don't make it smarter\n- **Too many subagents**: Start with 2-3 focused ones\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing:\n\n- [ ] Description is specific about when to delegate\n- [ ] Name uses kebab-case\n- [ ] One clear responsibility (not generic)\n- [ ] Prompt is concise but complete\n- [ ] Instructions are actionable\n- [ ] Output format is well defined\n- [ ] Model configuration appropriate\n\n## Output Messages\n\nWhen creating a subagent:\n\n```\n✅ Subagent created successfully!\n\n📁 Location: .agent/subagents/[name].md\n🎯 Purpose: [brief description]\n🔧 How to invoke:\n   - Automatic: Agent delegates when it detects [context]\n   - Explicit: /[name] [instruction]\n\n💡 Tip: Include keywords like \"use proactively\" to encourage delegation.\n```",
