# Harness Eval — plain-language glossary

Embedded at the top of `04-correctness.md`, `07-agreement.md`, and `10-usefulness-agreement.md`. Prefer verbs over jargon when talking to humans.

## The three tracks

| Track | Question it answers | Main report |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| **A — Correctness** | Is a cited path or command broken? | `04-correctness.md` |
| **B — Redundancy** | Would an agent rediscover this cheaply without the harness text? | `07-agreement.md` |
| **C — Usefulness** | Does this surface change agent behavior, or is it theory / demo / overlap? | `10-usefulness-agreement.md` |

**Do not equate tracks:** Ship (B) ≠ Slim (C). Rediscoverable ≠ useless. Useful ≠ non-redundant.

## Shared terms

| Term | Meaning | What you should do |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Trap gate PASS** | Planted fake claims/surfaces were scored correctly — judges are calibrated | Trust Ship / Slim bands |
| **Trap gate FAIL** | Judges failed discrimination plants | **Ignore** Ship / Slim; fix plants and re-run |
| **Hold** | Judges disagreed, score missing, or both unclear | **Do nothing** until you decide manually |
| **T0 / T1 / T2** | Always-on rules / skills / docs cited by them | Priority: edit T0 first (always loaded) |
| **`--seed`** | Scope inventory to a starting file + one-hop related skills/docs | Only that subgraph was evaluated |

## Track A

| Term | Meaning | What you should do |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **BROKEN** | Cited file/command does not exist (high-precision check) | Fix the cite or restore the file |

## Track B (redundancy)

| Term | Meaning | What you should do |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Ship** | Both judges: redundant **and** cheap to rediscover (cost ≤ 1) | **Safe to delete / trim** |
| **Review** | Both judges: keep (not redundant) | **Leave alone** for redundancy reasons |
| **REDUNDANT-CODE** | Echoes manifests/code layout | Candidate delete (only if Ship) |
| **REDUNDANT-GENERAL** | Generic advice, no repo-specific signal | Candidate delete (only if Ship) |
| **KEEP-POLICY / KEEP-CAVEAT / KEEP-ROUTING / KEEP-COMPRESSED** | Keep families | Leave alone |

## Track C (usefulness)

| Term | Meaning | What you should do |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Keep-core** | Most of the file **changes agent behavior** | **Do not slim** |
| **Mixed** | Real behavior-changing core **plus** large theory/examples/overlap | **Keep the rules; cut the bulk** |
| **Slim** | Mostly theory, repo-demo fluff, or overlap | **Compress or delete body** (model-sensitive) |
| **BEHAVIOR-CHANGING** | Without this text, agents likely do the wrong thing | Preserve |
| **REPO-DEMONSTRATED** | Already taught by opening 1–2 example files | Safe to cut |
| **THEORY** | General software advice | Safe to cut |
| **OVERLAP** | Same rule already in another harness file | Cut here; keep the canonical copy |
| **ROUTING-ONLY** | Triggers / pointers | Keep short |
