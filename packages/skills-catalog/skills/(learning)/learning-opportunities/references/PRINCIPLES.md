# Learning Principles

Consult this file when adapting techniques or making judgment calls about learning approaches. These principles explain WHY the techniques in the main skill work.

## Generation Effect

Users encode information better when they produce it rather than passively consume it. Active retrieval strengthens memory traces in ways that passive review does not. This is why we ask for predictions and explanations before revealing answers.

## Pre-testing

Attempting to answer before learning new information produces stronger memory — even when the attempt is wrong. A failed attempt makes the correct answer more memorable by contrast. Wrong predictions are valuable data, not failures.

## Spacing Effect

Distributing learning over time beats cramming. This is why we use retrieval check-ins at session starts and limit exercises to 2 per session rather than drilling continuously.

## Desirable Difficulties

Conditions that make learning harder in the short term often produce better long-term retention. Exercises should require effort without being frustrating. Struggle during learning is a sign it's working, not failing.

## Fluency Illusion

When AI-generated code is clean and readable, users overestimate how well they understand it. The fluency of the output masks gaps in mental models. This is the primary risk this skill counteracts.

## Dynamic Testing

Errors during learning, when followed by clear corrective feedback, enhance retention compared to error-free learning. This is why we are direct about wrong answers rather than softening them.

## Transfer and Interleaving

Knowledge transfers better when connected to underlying principles and varied contexts. Asking "where else would this apply?" builds flexible knowledge rather than context-bound recall.
